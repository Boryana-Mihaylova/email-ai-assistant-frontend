# Email AI Assistant

AI-powered inbox assistant for summarizing, prioritizing, and drafting email replies.

The user stays in control: no emails are sent automatically.  
AI behavior is intentionally simulated to ensure predictable demo results and safe experimentation. 

## About the Project

This application focuses on helping users summarize incoming messages, identify urgency, and prepare reply drafts for incoming emails.
AI is used as a decision-support tool rather than full automation, providing suggestions while leaving the final action to the user.
The user remains fully in control: no emails are sent automatically, and all actions require explicit approval.
The project is intentionally scoped as a focused demo to showcase API design, AI integration patterns, and UX-focused constraints.

## This project is split into two repositories: a React frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend

- Frontend repository: [email-ai-assistant-frontend](https://github.com/Boryana-Mihaylova/email-ai-assistant-frontend)
- Backend repository: [email-ai-assistant-backend](https://github.com/Boryana-Mihaylova/email-ai-assistant-backend)

---

## Demo Notes

The application includes a built-in demo mode with sample emails, allowing quick exploration of the main features without any setup.

Users can also test the application with their own emails by pasting content into the input area. Multiple emails can be analyzed together when separated by `---`.  
For pasted emails, a Clean Formatting button is provided to clean content from common email clients such as Gmail or Outlook.

AI behavior in the demo is intentionally simulated using predefined logic. No real emails are sent, and all reply actions are fully controlled by the user.

## Installation & Run

The application consists of two separate projects: a frontend and a backend service. Both need to be running for the application to work correctly.

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-ai-assistant-backend.git
   cd email-ai-assistant-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
The backend will be available at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000


### Frontend (React)

1. Clone the frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-ai-assistant-frontend.git
   cd email-ai-assistant-frontend
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
The frontend will be available at:
http://localhost:5173

Once both services are running, open the frontend URL in your browser to use the application.

## Future Improvements

- Improved input validation and clearer UX feedback for edge cases
- More advanced AI prompt logic and response handling
- Integration with real email providers (intentionally out of scope for the current demo)
